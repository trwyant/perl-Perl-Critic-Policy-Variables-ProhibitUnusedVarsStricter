    Remove 'mailto' bugtracker metadata Its presence appears to tell RT
    not to allow filings.

  Refactor the logic that discovers which variables are interpolated
    into double-quotish strings into PPIx::QuoteLike. This does not
    include regular expressions, which are already handled by
    PPIx::Regexp.

  Survive variable declarations that declare nothing. These can appear
    if (e.g.) PPI mis-parses an attribute list, and that attribute list
    contains something like 'Arg(state)'.

  Allow 'return ( my $x = 0 )'

    This construction can be used to return a temporary value from an lvalue
    subroutine. The case 'return my $x = 0' is equivalent, but was not
    recognized as defining a variable. Now both are recognized and accepted
    by default.

    If you want to reject these, there is a new Boolean configuration item,
    prohibit_returned_lexicals.

  Improve performance on really, really long strings This was done by
    rewriting the regular expression that finds interpolations to
    minimize backtracking.

  Required Perl::Critic version 1.119, since its scope computation is
    adequate for our needs. Got rid of our own scope computation code.
