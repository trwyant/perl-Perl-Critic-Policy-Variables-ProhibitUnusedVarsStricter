Perl-Critic policy. The files are:

README - This file.

unused-vars - This is a script that executes the
    ProhibitUnusedVarsStricter policy. It is more or less
    equivalent to
    $ perlcritic --single ProhibitUnusedVarsStricter
    but has its own configuration file. Use
    $ unused-vars --help
    for the documentation.
